## Setup Instructions

### Initial Setup

1. **Put Badge in Disk Mode:**
   - Tap the RESET button twice quickly
   - Badge will appear as USB drive

2. **Copy Files:**
   - Copy all files and folders to the badge
   - The badge filesystem should have `/system/` directory structure

3. **Configure WiFi (for Badge app):**
   - Edit `secrets.py`:
   ```python
   WIFI_SSID = "your-wifi-network"
   WIFI_PASSWORD = "your-wifi-password"
   GITHUB_USERNAME = "your-github-username"
   ```

4. **Restart:**
   - Eject the USB drive
   - Press RESET once to boot

### Customization

#### Add/Remove Apps from Menu

Edit `apps/menu/__init__.py` and modify the `apps` list:

```python
apps = [
    ("mona's quest", "quest"),
    ("mona pet", "monapet"),
    ("monasketch", "sketch"),
    ("flappy mona", "flappy"),
    ("gallery", "gallery"),
    ("badge", "badge"),
    ("debug info", "debug"),
]
```

Each entry is a tuple of `(display_name, folder_name)`.

#### Create Your Own App

1. Create a new folder in `apps/`
2. Add an `__init__.py` file with:
   - `update()` function - called every frame
   - Optional `init()` function - called once at startup
   - Optional `on_exit()` function - called when returning to menu
3. Add an `icon.png` (32x32 pixels)
4. Add your app to the menu list (see above)

Example minimal app:

```python
from badgeware import screen, brushes, shapes, run

def update():
    screen.brush = brushes.color(255, 255, 255)
    screen.draw(shapes.rectangle(0, 0, 160, 120))
    screen.text("Hello World!", 10, 50)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run(update)
```

## Technical Details

### Hardware
- **Device:** Badger2040 (Raspberry Pi RP2040)
- **Display:** 296x128 e-ink screen (rendered at 160x120)
- **Buttons:** A, B, C, UP, DOWN, HOME
- **IR Receiver:** Pin 21 (for Quest app)
- **WiFi:** Built-in (for Badge app)

### Software
- **Language:** MicroPython
- **Framework:** badgeware library (custom)
- **Graphics:** Pixel fonts, sprites, shapes API
- **Storage:** State persistence for save games

### Main Loop

The `main.py` file:
1. Shows startup animation (skippable)
2. Launches menu
3. User selects app
4. App runs until HOME button pressed
5. Returns to menu

### Button Handling
- HOME button triggers hardware interrupt to quit any app
- Each app implements its own button handling via `io.pressed` and `io.held`

### State Persistence

Apps can save state using the `State` API:

```python
from badgeware import State

# Save
State.save("app_name", {"key": "value"})

# Load
data = {}
State.load("app_name", data)
```

## Mona Character

The project features "Mona" - GitHub's Octocat mascot - in various sprite forms:
- `mona-default.png` - Normal standing/walking
- `mona-dance.png` - Dancing animation
- `mona-dead.png` - Dead/ghost form
- `mona-eating.png` - Eating animation
